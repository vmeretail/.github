## About VME

[VME Coop](https://vme.coop) are the leading software provider for retail co-ops in the UK.

We are also the largest software company in the world to [move into co-op ownership](https://vme.coop/blog/ef04609d-7212-11eb-a083-06ceb0bf34bd/vme-the-largest-worker-coop-conversion-of-a-tech-company-ever).
